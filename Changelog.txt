Moved packages around to extend into an Android version and a Java version for quicker developing, and to keep the two
libraries as close as possible.

Fixed a bug in temperature_Kelvin: It was previously calculated from temperature_Celsius - 273.15. It is now correctly
calculated as temperature_Celsius + 273.15. If you use a previous version of the library, you will need to add 2*273.15
to temperature_Kelvin to get the correct value.

Added uartInputStream. Anything read from the external uart will also get dumped into this input stream for easier
processing of data. (Similar for USB).

Fixed a bug in parsing batteryVoltage.

Fixed a bug in checking the oxidizing status (fired the reducing status event)
